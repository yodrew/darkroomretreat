### improve {#improve}

If you find a theoretical or practical error in the approach, or a way to improve it, please let me know. I am happy to alter the book if your proposal:

- presents a rational argument
- remains consonant with hygienic principles
- includes clear reports of your own reproducible experiments with the current method
- is offered courteously

Likewise, I would like to work with you in any way to develop hygienic dark retreating and advance its cause if you:

- have read my book 
- demonstrate understanding of its basic ideas
- have retreated according to my protocol and are convinced of the value of my approach

Cheers.
