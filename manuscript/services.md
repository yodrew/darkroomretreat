I do everything related to hygienic dark retreating: study, experiment, write, speak, consult, design, build, operate, support.

I do nothing related to active approaches to dark retreating: spiritual, therapeutic, or psychedelic. 

Find more information on everything below in my [____store____](https://hygienicdarkretreat.com/store).

### retreat {#retreat}

- I support retreats in person at my place or yours. They are 11 days: a [____9-day Czech____](#czech)&nbsp;_-​4_ retreat + 2 buffer days. 

	The process is to read, [____confer____](https://hygienicdarkretreat.com/store/confer), [____enroll____](https://hygienicdarkretreat.com/store/enroll), book, and retreat.
- I support retreats remotely. This also begins with reading and conferring.
- If you plan to retreat on your own, I can confer with you about your questionnaire by email and phone.

Marion Abbott of Australia at [____Profound Rest Retreats____](https://profoundrest.wordpress.com) is also organizing retreats. Simen Kirkerød of Norway can do it, too (write me).
